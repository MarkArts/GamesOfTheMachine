# Timinator (Games of the Machine)
Timinator is a game we made for the minor Game Design and Development at the University of Applied Sciences of Rotterdam. 
You can download the game in the [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Ludos.GamesOfTheMachine).

## Setup
To load the game in unity you simply need to clone the repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com/MarkArts/GamesOfTheMachine.git
```
Then open Unity and select open and choose the folder you cloned the repo in.

## Name changes
When we created the project it was simply called gravitygame after that we switched to Games of the Machine en now it is called Timinator. So when you see one of those names in code it's probaply there because we couldn't change it (easily)
